# Product Recognition on Store Shelves

The goal of this project is to use computer vision techniques to
perform object detection. We want a system able to recognize cereal
boxes on store shelves. The task is complex, due to the high number
of different possible variation in which the same object can occur
into the scene. Our solution combines the SIFT algorithm and the
Mean Shift clustering scheme.
